# Idle-Space
A space-themed Idle RPG

This is a weird project of mine I have been messing with for a month or so now. (As of 10/8/24)
Almost the entirety of the code is AI-written. I am purposely challenging myself (someone who does not code) to attempt to use
AI to create a game from scratch. It's not an overly complex game, or at least I thought it wasn't.
However the longer I go into this, the more over my head everything seems.
All that aside, I am having fun and if there are any issues found, let me know!
